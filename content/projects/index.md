Here are a couple of my past projects:

#### **Blackjack in Java**

This project was my implementation of the card game Blackjack using the programming language Java.

#### **Red-Black Tree Generator**

In this project, I explored red-black binary search trees and how to visualize them in the terminal using Java.
